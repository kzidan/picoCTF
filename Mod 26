Description: This challenge has the hint "Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd}"
We can assume the later half of this text is ciphertext encoded in ROT13 which is a type of caesar cipher.

*Steps*
1) Open a terminal
2) Used command 'echo "cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd}" | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]''
                  ^                           ^                                  ^      ^             ^
          command to display text   cipher text from hint                        |     set 1         set 2
                                                                                 |
